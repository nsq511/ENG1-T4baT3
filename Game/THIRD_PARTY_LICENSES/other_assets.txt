Subject to the Prohibited Uses described below (which you agree and acknowledge you are not entitled to engage in), when you download any Content that is not CC0 Content from the Service, we grant you an irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual (or as long as allowed by law), non-exclusive and royalty-free right to download, use, copy, modify or adapt the Content for commercial or non-commercial purposes ('Content License'). The rights granted are non-exclusive, meaning that we may also grant other users the same rights in the same Content. For the avoidance of doubt, you do not obtain any rights in any other usersâ€™ Communications.

You agree and acknowledge that the following items are "Prohibited Uses" and the Content License which we grant to you is conditional on you not engaging in any of the Prohibited Uses.

    You cannot sell or distribute the Content (either in digital or physical form) on a Standalone basis. This includes selling or distributing Content on a Standalone basis as an image, audio, video, NFT or other digital file (including through a stock media platform), as well as a print, wallpaper, poster or on merchandise or on other physical products.

    When we refer to "Standalone" we mean where no creative effort has been applied to the Content and it remains in substantially the same form as it exists on the Service. To help illustrate this, here are some examples:
        using the Content in its original form or solely using a filter, changing colors, resizing or cropping the Content remains Standalone use.
        using the Content with a combination of images, videos, audio files, other media, text, illustrations, background features and editing techniques is not Standalone use, so long as the combined effect is to make a "new" creative work.
    If Content depicts any trademarks, logos or brands (whether two- or three-dimensional), you cannot use that Content for commercial purposes in relation to goods and services, in particular not print that Content on merchandise or other physical products for sale.
    You cannot use Content in any immoral or illegal way, especially Content which features a recognisable person. You cannot use any Content on or in conjunction with anything pornographic, obscene, offensive (including but not limited to in relation to adult entertainment venues, escort services, drug use, dating services, in a way which portrays someone as suffering from, or medicating for, a physical or mental ailment), illegal, immoral, infringing, defamatory, hateful, threatening or libellous in nature, in a political context (such as the promotion, advertisement or endorsement of any party, candidate, or elected official or in connection with any political party or viewpoint) or in breach of any law, regulation or industry code, or in any way which infringes the rights of any person or entity.
    You cannot use Content in a misleading or deceptive way. You cannot use Content in a way that is misleading or deceptive, including without limit:
        by suggesting that any depicted person, brand, organisation or other third party endorses or is affiliated with you or your goods or services, unless permission has been granted; or
        by giving the impression that Content was created by you, or a person other than the intellectual property rights holder of the Content (including without limitation, by claiming or giving the impression that you hold ownership of, or exclusive rights to, the Content).
    You cannot use any of the Content as part of a trade-mark, design-mark, trade-name, business name or service mark.

In addition to the Prohibited Uses, please be aware that certain Content (including CC0 Content) may be subject to additional intellectual property rights (such as copyrights, trademarks, design rights), moral rights, proprietary rights, property rights, privacy rights or similar. This includes but is not limited to identifiable people, logos, brands of all kinds (whether two- or three- dimensional), goods or services, buildings and architecture, audio or video samples and organisations.

Before using any Content (including CC0 Content), you must consider whether you require the consent of a third party or a license to use the Content. If your use of the Content is for commercial purposes (e.g. in conjunction with the sale or promotion of a product or service) then it is likely that you will need consent or a license. Responsibility for determining whether permissions are needed always rests solely and exclusively with you. We do not warrant that any consents or licenses have been obtained in relation to any Content, and we expressly disclaim any and all responsibility and liability in relation to such matters.
